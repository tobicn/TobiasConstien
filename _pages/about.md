Hi there! Welcome to my academic portfolio. I am <b>Tobias Constien</b> – but you should feel free to just call me Tobi! I am currently a PhD Candidate at the [UCD Babylab](https://www.ucdbabylab.com) in the School of Psychology at the University College Dublin. I’m being supervised by [Dr. Michelle Downes](https://people.ucd.ie/michelle.downes).

I’m broadly interested in the psychological mechanisms and functions of play, whether it’s in development, therapy, or simply how I can win against my wife in board games. In my PhD, for example, I am exploring the role of pretend play in toddlers' development of executive functions. In my work in dramatherapy, I'm looking at play from a clinical perspective. Nonetheless, I still usually loose in board games against my wife.

Current Projects
======

One of the wonderful <i>(and sometimes horrible)</i> things about working in and around academia, is that you always have a number of projects ongoing at the same time. This is a snippet of my to-do list right now:

- <b>[TEDDY Project](https://www.ucdbabylab.com/teddy-project):</b> My wonderful, fun PhD Project on toddlers' play and executive functions.
- <b>Fatherhood Study</b>: A meaningful qualitative study on the experience of becoming a father for the very first time.
- <b>[SCOOT Study](https://osf.io/a5473/overview):</b> The SCOOT study looks at toddlers' sleep, screen-time, and play in Ireland.
- <b>[EFD Case Study Project](https://osf.io/p4tzc/overview):</b> A collaborative pilot from the European Federation of Dramatherapy and the Dramatherapy Journal.
- <b>[Adults Play Too!](https://osf.io/wcdga/overview):</b> A systematic review mapping quantitative measures of adult playfulness.
