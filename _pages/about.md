Hi there! Welcome to my academic portfolio. I am Tobias Constien – but you should feel free to just call me Tobi! I am currently a PhD Candidate at the UCD Babylab in the School of Psychology at the University College Dublin. I’m being supervised by [Dr. Michelle Downes](https://people.ucd.ie/michelle.downes).

In my PhD, I am primarily focusing on pretend play and the development of executive functions in the toddlerhood period. However, since I have a background in creative arts therapies, you’ll notice that I also have some research interests in that field. I’m broadly interested in the psychological mechanisms and functions of play, whether it’s in development, therapy, or simply how I can win against my wife in board games.

I’m trying my best to conduct my research following principles of Open Science. I haven’t always been able to publish open-access, however, materials and pre-prints from all my work is openly available via my [OSF Page](https://osf.io/hwqnx/). You can also download my papers (or pre-prints) via this [page](https://tobicn.github.io/TobiasConstien/publications/
).

Current Projects
======

One of the wonderful (and sometimes horrible) things about working in and around academia, is that you always have a number of projects ongoing at the same time. This is what I'm working on right now:

- [TEDDY Project](https://www.ucdbabylab.com/teddy-project): My wonderful, fun PhD Project on toddlers' play and executive functions.
- [SCOOT Study](https://osf.io/a5473/overview): The SCOOT study looks at toddlers' sleep, screen-time, and play in Ireland.
- [EFD Case Study Project](https://osf.io/p4tzc/overview): A collaborative pilot from the European Federation of Dramatherapy and the Dramatherapy Journal.
- [Adults Play Too!](https://osf.io/wcdga/overview): A systematic review mapping quantitative measures of adult playfulness.
