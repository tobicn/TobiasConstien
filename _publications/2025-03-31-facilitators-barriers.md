Poverty and its multifaceted consequences, including stigmatization, prolonged periods of stress and social exclusion, negatively impact mental well-being. Due to an increasing prevalence of poverty, there is a need, aside from economic and political intervention, to develop accessible, and inclusive resources to promote and maintain mental well-being. Within this context, dramatherapy has been posited to be suited to support affected individuals. Yet little research has explored its application with people affected by poverty. Using an instrumental case study design and a qualitative descriptive approach, this study sought to provide an initial exploration of dramatherapy as a source of psychological support for people affected by poverty. The cases of two individuals, Daniel and Bianca, with experiences of poverty before, during and after the COVID-19 pandemic were selected from a larger qualitative study. Their experiences of poverty are being described and their perceived barriers and facilitators of potentially participating in group dramatherapy are named. Both participants are open to engaging in group dramatherapy. They identify several facilitating aspects, yet also note barriers that could limit or prevent their participation. Predominantly, financial worries are named as potential barriers. Other concerns, such as time constraints, accessibility and physical fitness, were also identified. Overall, this case study shows the complexity of poverty and its impact on individuals’ mental well-being and mental health support. It encourages further study and may inform dramatherapy interventions targeting people affected by poverty.
